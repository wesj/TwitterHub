TwitterHub
==========

Firefox Hub addon for Twitter


-- Known Issues --
This does some page scraping to find content in order to avoid some insecure OAuth tricks. Looking
for a better option someday, but for now, this is simple and works easily for any user who's ever visited Twitter in
Fennec before.
